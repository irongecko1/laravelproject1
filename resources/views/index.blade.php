    <strong>Tailwind CSS Tutorial</strong>
    <p class="mt-4 text-md leading-6 col-start-1 sm:col-span-2 lg:mt-6 lg:row-start-4 lg:col-span-1 dark:text-slate-400">Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes building custom user interfaces fast and easy. Tailwind
        is designed to be highly customizable, enabling developers and designers to build completely bespoke designs
        without ever leaving the comfort of a single stylesheet. With Tailwind, you get access to a wide range of
        utility classes that make it easy to create complex, responsive layouts with minimal code.</p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-md leading-6 col-start-1 sm:col-span-2 lg:mt-6 lg:row-start-4 lg:col-span-1 dark:text-slate-400">Tailwind's utility-first approach lets you focus on the content of your designs, rather than getting bogged down
        in the details. Tailwind's classes are designed to be highly specific and composable, so you can mix and match
        them to create custom designs without writing any custom CSS. Tailwind also makes it easy to customize the look
        and feel of your designs with themeable variables and custom color palettes.</p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-md leading-6 col-start-1 sm:col-span-2 lg:mt-6 lg:row-start-4 lg:col-span-1 dark:text-slate-400">Tailwind includes all the features you'd expect from a modern CSS framework, including ready-made components,
        responsive breakpoints, and powerful plugins. Tailwind also includes a built-in linter to help you keep your
        code clean and maintainable. With Tailwind, you get all the benefits of a modern CSS framework without any of
        the hassle of writing custom CSS.</p>

    <p class="mt-4 text-md leading-6 col-start-1 sm:col-span-2 lg:mt-6 lg:row-start-4 lg:col-span-1 dark:text-slate-400">Tailwind is a great choice for developers and designers who want to quickly create custom designs without
        sacrificing maintainability or performance. Whether you're building a complex web application or a simple
        landing page, Tailwind makes it easy to create beautiful, responsive designs with minimal effort.</p>
